📘 Day 2 – Type Casting & Operators in C++
🚀 Overview

This folder contains my Day 2 practice of C++ fundamentals.

Today’s focus was on:

--Type Casting

--Operators in C++

---Understanding expression evaluation

These concepts are important for writing efficient and logical programs.

1️⃣ **typecasting.cpp**

This file demonstrates:

Implicit Type Casting (Automatic conversion)

Explicit Type Casting (Manual conversion using (type))

🔹 Topics Covered:

--Conversion between int, float, double

--Data loss during type conversion

--Using type casting in calculations
